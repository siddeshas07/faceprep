Sum of even numbers and sum of odd numbers
Arun and Kalai were playing a puzzle game with a given set of numbers. They need to find the odd and even numbers and find the sum of the odd numbers and the sum of the even numbers. Write a program to help them to solve the puzzle game and to win the mobile phone.
Input Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers. 

The first integer corresponds to ‘n’, the size of the array. 

The next ‘n’ integers correspond to the elements in the array. 

Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.

Output Format:

Refer to sample output for details.

Sample Input:

5

2

3

6

8

-1

Sample Output:

The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16

The sum of the odd numbers in the array is 2



#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  int od=0,even=0,i,a[89],n;
  //Type your code here.
  std::cin>>n;
  for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    cin>>a[i];
  for(i=0;i<n;i++){
    if(a[i]%2==0)
      even=even+a[i];
  else
    od=od+a[i];
  }
  std::cout<<"The sum of the even numbers in the array is "<<even<<"\n";
  std::cout<<"The sum of the odd numbers in the array is "<<od;
}
